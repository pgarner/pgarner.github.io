# Who?

![Mugshot](assets/mugshot.jpg){:width="15%"}

I work generally in the Speech and Audio Processing group at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/), and particularly with

* [Alexandre Bittar](https://www.idiap.ch/~abittar/)
* [Louise Coppieters](https://www.idiap.ch/~lcoppieters/)
* [Haolin Chen](https://www.idiap.ch/~hchen/)

We focus on the conjunction of speech recognition and speech synthesis.  In each case, we try to focus on physiologically plausible systems. Here is a short [bio](ieee-bio.html).

# Paper trail

* My [reviewed publications](png-pubs.html). These are also indexed by
[Google Scholar](http://idiap.ch/~pgarner/scholar).

* A (possibly incomplete) list of [my patents](png-pats.html). They are
mainly US, but in practice most of these began life as either GB or Japan
patents; the US ones are just easier to reference.

* Other [technical reports](png-tech.html) that are not commercial in
confidence or published elsewhere. The list includes some MPEG submissions that
made it into MPEG-7.

# Boards

I'm a Senior Area Editor for [IEEE Signal Processing Letters](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-signal-processing-letters/editorial-board).  I'm also on the Editorial Board for [Speech Communication](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/speech-communication/editorial-board).

# Software

Most work is on my [GitHub](http://github.com/pgarner) page.

* For a while now I've been trying to find a sustainable way of maintaining software for the group. [BuSLR](https://github.com/idiap/buslr) was a failed attempt, but does contain some useful conda recipes.  Right now, the most promising approach is [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/), for which I maintain a [tap](https://github.com/pgarner/homebrew-tap).
* [SSP](https://github.com/idiap/ssp) is a signal processing library in python.
It contains, amongst other things, a feature extractor and [continuous pitch estimator](http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/2451). [libssp](https://github.com/idiap/libssp) duplicates some functionality in a C++ library.
* [ISS](https://github.com/idiap/iss) is/was a framework for building and
evaluating ASR and TTS models.  Based around HTS it's quite old.
* I wrote and (infrequently) maintain [Tracter](https://github.com/idiap/tracter), a data-flow framework that
formed the feature acquisition mechanism of [Juicer](https://github.com/idiap/juicer).  Tracter wraps several other
packages, including libssp.

Software ages; Juicer and ISS were effectively replaced by [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org).


# Teaching

Since May 2019, [Ina Kodrasi](https://www.idiap.ch/~ikodrasi/) and I teach the course "Fundamentals of Statistics for AI" for
[UniDistance](https://distanceuniversity.ch/artificial-intelligence/master/programme/).  The course was originally designed with
[David Ginsbourger](http://www.ginsbourger.ch/).
A while ago now, I held a lecturer position at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/), and
taught a [course on Speech Signal Processing](ssp-course.html).

# Contact

Look at the username above and add `@idiap.ch`. It'll probably get
here. Otherwise try the
[Idiap contact page](http://www.idiap.ch/en/people/directory/306).

# Also...

I'm on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/philipngarner), but have a more on/off relationship with [facebook](facebook.html) and the like.  Some are below; finding any others is left as an exercise for the user.
