# Who?

![Mugshot](assets/mugshot.jpg){:width="15%" border="1"}

I am a Senior Researcher at [Idiap Research
Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/), where I lead the [Audio Inference Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/audio-inference).  We work generally in artificial intelligence and particularly in speech processing on the conjunction of recognition and synthesis.  In each case, we try to focus on physiologically plausible and statistically rigorous systems.  Here is a short [bio](ieee-bio.html).

# Paper trail

* My [reviewed publications](png-pubs.html). These are also indexed by
[Google Scholar](http://idiap.ch/~pgarner/scholar) and by [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0814-1348).

* A (possibly incomplete) list of [my patents](png-pats.html). They are
mainly US, but in practice most of these began life as either GB or Japan
patents; the US ones are just easier to reference.

* Other [technical reports](png-tech.html) that are not commercial in
confidence or published elsewhere. The list includes some MPEG submissions that
made it into MPEG-7.

# Boards

I'm a Senior Area Editor for [IEEE Signal Processing Letters](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-signal-processing-letters/editorial-board), and on the Editorial Board for [Speech Communication](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/speech-communication/editorial-board).

# Software

Most work is on my [GitHub](http://github.com/pgarner) page.

* I spent some time trying to find a sustainable way of maintaining software for the group. [BuSLR](https://github.com/idiap/buslr) was a failed attempt, but does contain some useful conda recipes.  Also promising was [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/), for which I made a [tap](https://github.com/pgarner/homebrew-tap).  Finally Ewan came along with a solution based on [modules](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [spack](https://spack.io/).
* [SSP](https://github.com/idiap/ssp) is a signal processing library in python.
It contains, amongst other things, a feature extractor and [continuous pitch estimator](http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/2451). [libssp](https://github.com/idiap/libssp) duplicates some functionality in a C++ library.
* [ISS](https://github.com/idiap/iss) is/was a framework for building and
evaluating ASR and TTS models.  Based around HTS it's quite old.
* I wrote and (infrequently) maintain [Tracter](https://github.com/idiap/tracter), a data-flow framework that
formed the feature acquisition mechanism of [Juicer](https://github.com/idiap/juicer).  Tracter wraps several other
packages, including libssp.

Software ages; Juicer and ISS were effectively replaced by [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org).  In my team we tend to use [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based toolkits now.


# Teaching

Between May 2019 and July 2023, [Ina Kodrasi](https://www.idiap.ch/~ikodrasi/) and I taught the course "Fundamentals of Statistics for AI" for
[UniDistance](https://unidistance.ch/en/mathematics-and-computer-science).  The course was originally designed with
[David Ginsbourger](http://www.ginsbourger.ch/).

Via the [LIDIAP lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/idiap/) I hold a [lecturer position at EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/philip.garner).  A while ago now I
taught a [course on Speech Signal Processing](ssp-course.html).

I'm on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/philipngarner), but have a more on/off relationship with [facebook](facebook.html) and the like.  Some are below; finding any others is left as an exercise for the user.
