Philip N. Garner received the degree of M.Eng. in Electronic
Engineering from the University of Southampton, U.K., in 1991, and the degree
of Ph.D. (by publication) from the University of East Anglia, U.K., in 2012.

He first joined the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in Malvern,
Worcestershire working on pattern recognition and later speech processing.  In
1998 he moved to Canon Research Centre Europe in Guildford, Surrey, where he
designed speech recognition metadata for retrieval.  In 2001, he was seconded
(and subsequently transfered) to the speech group at Canon Inc. in Tokyo,
Japan, to work on multilingual aspects of speech recognition and noise
robustness.

As of April 2007, he is a senior research scientist at Idiap Research
Institute, Martigny, Switzerland, where he continues to work in research and
development of speech recognition, synthesis and signal processing.

He is a senior member of the IEEE, and has published internationally in
conference proceedings, patent, journal and book form as well as serving as
coordinating editor of ISO/IEC 15938-4 (MPEG-7 Audio).  He currently serves as
senior area editor for IEEE Signal Processing Letters and on the editorial
board of Speech Communication.
