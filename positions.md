# Overview

We are always looking for good people at Idiap.  Any open position will be
advertised on the
[Idiap jobs page](http://www.idiap.ch/en/join-us/job-opportunities); all are
funded except the speculative positions.  A speculative application is useful
if you anticipate a position being available soon, or if you have your own
funding.

# PhD students

With Hervé Bourlard, I have one opening for a PhD student on a new SNSF NCCR project:
* [Low Level Mechanisms of Language Evolution](http://www.idiap.ch/education-and-jobs/job-10284)

All the information is on that page.  SNSF is good for PhDs; it's real research
funding including travel and without commitments to industrial or EU project
partners.  An NCCR is a good opportunity to collaborate with other similar work in Switzerland

# Post doctoral researchers

Right now I have no openings for post-docs, but there are several within the wider speech group (see the jobs page above).

Idiap can be a good place to do a post-doc.  If you want an academic career, it
is a springboard to a position elsewhere.  If you want to run a startup, it is
easy to transition into the [IdeArk incubator](http://www.ideark.ch/en/).  If
you are undecided, a post-doc can provide time to make an informed decision.

# Engineers

Recently we have more and more tech-transfer opportunities.  To this end we
created the post of R&D engineer.  However, there are no open positions right
now.

The position would suit someone with a bachelors, masters or even PhD, but who
perhaps does not want an academic career.


# Interns

Right now I don't have funding for internships (although if you are funded feel free to get in touch).

Unless you have your own funding, interns are funded by Idiap with a stipend of
CHF ~2,500 per month.  In Martigny, this will pay rent, food and (some) beer;
you probably won't save anything.  An internship is suitable for someone doing
a masters and needing a project, or with a masters waiting to take a PhD
position.  It may also suit a PhD student wanting to broaden their knowledge.
An internship is not suitable for a PhD graduate unless you have a very clear
idea of where you're going next.
