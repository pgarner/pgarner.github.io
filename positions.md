# Overview

We are always looking for good people at Idiap.  Any open position will be advertised on the [Idiap careers page](https://www.idiap.ch/en/careers); all are funded except the speculative positions.  A speculative application is useful if you anticipate a position being available soon, or if you have your own funding.

# Interns

I have modest funding for internships; the subjects are open, but should be related to the research that is being done in the wider [group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/audio-inference).

Unless you have your own funding, interns are funded by Idiap with a stipend of CHF ~3,000 per month.  In Martigny, this will pay rent, food and (some) beer; you probably won't save anything.  An internship is suitable for someone doing a masters and needing a project, or with a masters waiting to take a PhD position.  It can also suit current a PhD student wanting to broaden their knowledge.  An internship is not suitable for a PhD graduate unless you have a very clear idea of where you're going next.

If you are funded feel free to get in touch anytime.

# PhD students

I currently have *two* open PhD position on [Generative modelling using Spiking Networks](https://careers.werecruit.io/fr/idiap/offres/phd-positions-in-generative-modeling-using-spiking-networks-83c37b).  These are funded by the [Swiss NSF](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/10004827), that's to say: very open funding to do real research.

Otherwise, all the information is on the Idiap jobs page.  SNSF is good for PhDs; it's real research funding including travel and without commitments to industrial partners.  It's also a good opportunity to collaborate with interesting partners.

# Post doctoral researchers

I *may* be able to fund a post-doc on the [generative spiking net](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/10004827) project above
Idiap can be a good place to do a post-doc.  If you want an academic career, it is a springboard to a position elsewhere.  If you want to run a startup, it is easy to transition into the [IdeArk incubator](http://www.ideark.ch/en/).  If you are undecided, a post-doc can provide time to make an informed decision.
