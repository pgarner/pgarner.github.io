# Overview

We are always looking for good people at Idiap.  Any open position will be
advertised on the
[Idiap jobs page](http://www.idiap.ch/en/join-us/job-opportunities); all are
funded except the speculative positions.  A speculative application is useful
if you anticipate a position being available soon, or if you have your own
funding.

# PhD students

I currently have no open PhD positions

Otherwise, all the information is on the Idiap jobs page.  SNSF is good for PhDs; it's real research funding including travel and without commitments to industrial partners.  It's also a good opportunity to collaborate with interesting partners.


# Post doctoral researchers

Idiap can be a good place to do a post-doc.  If you want an academic career, it
is a springboard to a position elsewhere.  If you want to run a startup, it is
easy to transition into the [IdeArk incubator](http://www.ideark.ch/en/).  If
you are undecided, a post-doc can provide time to make an informed decision.

# Engineers

Recently we have more and more tech-transfer opportunities.  To this end we
created the post of R&D engineer.  However, there are no open positions right
now.

The position would suit someone with a bachelors, masters or even PhD, but who
perhaps does not want an academic career.


# Interns

Whilst I don't have explicit funding for internships, I could support one.  Get in touch if you have good reason.

If you are funded feel free to get in touch anytime.

Unless you have your own funding, interns are funded by Idiap with a stipend of
CHF ~2,500 per month.  In Martigny, this will pay rent, food and (some) beer;
you probably won't save anything.  An internship is suitable for someone doing
a masters and needing a project, or with a masters waiting to take a PhD
position.  It may also suit a PhD student wanting to broaden their knowledge.
An internship is not suitable for a PhD graduate unless you have a very clear
idea of where you're going next.
